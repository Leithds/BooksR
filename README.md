# Overview

In this project, I am demonstrating my ability to work with R, a powerful language for statistical computing and data analysis. The goal was to create a book recommendation system based on user preferences, where users can input the title of a book they like, specify their preferred rating and page limits, and filter results based on language. Through this, I aimed to enhance my understanding of R's syntax, data manipulation capabilities, and user input handling.

I wrote this software to improve my skills in R, particularly in working with dataframes, loops, and conditional logic. The project also introduced me to error handling, file I/O operations, and user-friendly features like filtering and language selection. It has been a great way to demonstrate the practical applications of R for data manipulation and statistical analysis.

The main focus of this project was to learn how to leverage R's powerful data processing and output capabilities while ensuring that the software was both functional and easy for users to interact with.

# Development Environment

- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries Used**: `dplyr`, `stringr`
- **Development Tools**: RStudio
- **Data File**: `books.csv` (This dataset contains a variety of books with details such as title, authors, rating, pages, etc.)

# Future Work

There are a few things I plan to improve and add in the future:

- **Refining the recommendation logic**: I could add more complex logic to recommend books based on genres, publication year, or even collaborative filtering.
- **Improve file export**: Add more export formats, like CSV or Excel, for user-friendly data analysis.
- **User interface**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use, so users donâ€™t have to interact via the command line.
- **Expand dataset**: Increase the variety of books in the dataset to make recommendations more diverse.
